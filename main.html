        <h3>Title: The Case for Nuclear Energy: Powering the Future Responsibly</h3>

        <h4>I. Introduction</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hook:</strong> Imagine a future where the air is clean, cities are powered sustainably, and carbon emissions are a thing of the past.</li>
            <li><strong>Connecting information:</strong> With climate change becoming a growing threat and fossil fuels causing environmental damage, alternative energy sources are crucial. Among them, nuclear energy stands out.</li>
            <li><strong>Thesis statement:</strong> Nuclear energy should be used as a primary energy source because it is efficient, sustainable, and helps reduce carbon emissions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>II. Body Paragraph 1</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Topic sentence:</strong> Nuclear energy is one of the most efficient sources of electricity.</li>
            <li><strong>Supporting details:</strong> It produces significantly more energy than solar or wind per unit; nuclear power plants can operate continuously without interruption for months.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>III. Body Paragraph 2</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Topic sentence:</strong> Nuclear energy is environmentally friendly and reduces greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
            <li><strong>Supporting details:</strong> Unlike coal or gas, nuclear power doesn’t emit carbon dioxide; it plays a crucial role in meeting global climate goals like those in the Paris Agreement.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>IV. Body Paragraph 3</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Counterargument:</strong> Critics argue that nuclear energy is dangerous due to the risk of accidents and radioactive waste.</li>
            <li><strong>Refutation:</strong> Modern technology has made nuclear power plants much safer. Waste can be securely stored, and incidents like Chernobyl are extremely rare today.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>V. Conclusion</h4>
        <p>Nuclear energy offers a realistic and responsible solution to global energy needs. With its high efficiency and low environmental impact, it deserves serious consideration as we transition toward a cleaner, more sustainable future.</p>
