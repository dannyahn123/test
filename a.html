                Kim Koo was a national leader who dedicated his life to the independence of his country by leading the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea. Featuring his portrait on the 100,000-won banknote holds significant meaning in inheriting and honoring the historical legitimacy and independent spirit of the Republic of Korea. Furthermore, it can announce both domestically and internationally Korea's commitment to the self-reliant and culturally prosperous nation he dreamed of. This will inspire national pride and contribute to instilling a proper view of the state and historical consciousness in future generations.
